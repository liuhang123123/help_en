# Tokenomics

## Bitrader Business Module

{% hint style="info" %}
Bitrader's platform's revenue comes from **brokerage fee earnings** generated through the exchanges.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Buybacks

* **90% of platform earnings** (with 10% reserved for platform technical and operational costs) will be used to **buy back Bitrader Tokens**.
* The **100% of tokens bought back** are allocated to the community, referred to as the **Community Total Earnings**.
* These earnings are processed by the system, which follows a set allocation rule: a portion is burned, and the remainder is distributed to nodes.

## Deflatory Nature

* **25% of the Community Total Earnings** is used to **buy back and burn Bitrader Tokens**, reducing the overall supply and creating a deflationary effect.
* **Burn Time**: The tokens repurchased the previous month are burned on the **5th of each month**.

## Distribution

* The remaining **75% of the Community Total Earnings** is allocated to nodes, referred to as the **Node Total Income**. Nodes are responsible for distributing these tokens to their users.
* Each node has the flexibility to determine the **distribution ratio** between the node and its associated users.

## **User Earnings**:

User earnings are distributed by the partnered node, based on the **Node Total Income**. The distribution is done according to a pre-set ratio, which is automatically managed by the system based on the node's configuration.
