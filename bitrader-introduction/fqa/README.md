## Is Bitrader a Quantitative Trading Software?

Bitrader is not a quantitative trading software. Instead, it is a manual, quick arbitrage app designed for users who engage in high-frequency, low-margin, stable arbitrage trading on minute-to-hour timeframes. The app is designed to make trading interactions more convenient.

After users authorize API access in Bitrader, they can connect to exchanges to trade USDT-based perpetual contracts (currently, only OKX USDT-based perpetual contract pairs are supported). Once the trading configuration is set, a single click allows Bitrader to help users complete a round-trip trade (opening and closing a position). However, just like trading directly on an exchange, users must remain vigilant about the market risks associated with cryptocurrency price fluctuations.
