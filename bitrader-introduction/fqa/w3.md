## Do You Need to Deposit Cryptocurrency into Bitrader to Trade?

Users do not need to deposit any cryptocurrency into Bitrader to trade. Your cryptocurrency assets remain in your exchange account, such as on the OKX exchange, where you manage them yourself. Bitraderâ€™s role is to execute your trading instructions, helping you conduct buying and selling operations more conveniently on exchanges like OKX.
