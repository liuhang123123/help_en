# How Does Bitrader Work

## **Community Partnership**&#x20;

Bitrader is a platform co-created and jointly developed by community partners.

### Vision

To serve millions of trading users and make trading more stable.



### Philosophy

While users enjoy the convenience of using Bitrader, they also share in the benefits of Bitrader Token earnings.

## Profit Sharing with the Community

The platform allocates 90% of its earnings to repurchase Bitrader Tokens. After repurchasing, 25% of these tokens are destroyed, and 75% are distributed to nodes, which then distribute the earnings to users associated with those nodes. For more details, please refer to the token economy model.
