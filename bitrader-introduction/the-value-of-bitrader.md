## Stability

Making trading more robust is the original intent behind the launch of Bitrader.

## Simplicity

In the process of trading on the secondary cryptocurrency market, we often find ourselves switching back and forth between market overview screens and order placement screens. This can affect our ability to seize specific market opportunities, especially during volatile periods. With Bitrader, you can open and close positions with just a few clicks, significantly simplifying the trading process and enhancing your trading efficiency.

## Peace of Mind

Bitrader’s “Arbitrage Setting” feature allows users to automatically set up both opening and closing orders, eliminating the need to manually place separate closing orders after opening a position. This feature makes trading more worry-free and helps users who aim for low-risk, stable profits to easily execute quick arbitrage trades.
