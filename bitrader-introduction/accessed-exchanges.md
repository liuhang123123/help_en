# Exchange Integration

## Exchanges Integrated with Bitrader

Bitrader is currently integrated with the OKX exchange. Both new and existing users of OKX can apply for an API on the official OKX platform, configure it within the Bitrader App, and use Bitrader to perform cryptocurrency arbitrage trading (specifically for USDT-based perpetual contracts).\
\
In the future, Bitrader will gradually support other top-ranked exchanges worldwide.
