# API Configuration

## What is an API？

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of definitions, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications or services to communicate with each other. Essentially, an API acts as an interface that enables one software application or service to interact with another without needing to know the internal workings of the other. It simplifies the process of integrating different systems by providing standardized communication methods.
