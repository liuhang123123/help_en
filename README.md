# Product Introduction

## Bitrader

Bitrader is an app designed for high-frequency manual trading of USDT perpetual contracts on the OKX exchange. It offers a streamlined and efficient trading experience, particularly suited for volatile markets. The app's key feature is the ability to automatically close positions based on user-defined values when the market reaches the specified price. It caters to low-risk arbitrage and frequent traders with a user-friendly interface. Upgrading to Bitrader Pro provides additional rewards in Bitrader Tokens.

## How Does Bitrader Conduct Trades？

Bitrader conducts cryptocurrency trades by integrating with the OKX exchange through an API connection. <mark style="color:blue;">**Users’ cryptocurrency assets are securely stored in their OKX exchange accounts, and users retain full control over managing these assets.**</mark> Bitrader does not manage or hold any cryptocurrency assets.

Bitrader provides users with innovative trading models and enhanced earning opportunities through advanced trading concepts. When users initiate trades on Bitrader, the platform sends trading instructions to the OKX exchange via the API. All order matching and execution are handled on the OKX exchange itself.

## How to get hands on your first trade?

For users who **do not have an OKX trading account** or have an **OKX account that has not been active for over 180 days**, please make sure to register (new users) or log in to reactivate your account (existing users) using the following link: [OKX Registration Link](https://www.okx.com/join/2851712).[<mark style="color:red;">**https://www.okx.com/join/2851712**</mark>](https://www.okx.com/join/2851712)



After users complete the API configuration in the Bitrader App (API obtained from OKX), they can start using Bitrader to trade cryptocurrencies (currently, only OKX USDT-based perpetual contract pairs are supported).\

## Concept

In the cryptocurrency secondary market, investments can be categorized by "cycle and trading frequency." These include "long-term Bitcoin investments (1-3 years), daily swing trading (several weeks to months), or high-frequency trading on minute-to-hour charts." Bitrader is specifically designed for high-frequency trading on shorter timeframes, focusing on low-risk, stable trades. It is particularly useful for high-frequency, high-leverage traders, allowing them to set profit targets and automatically close positions, enhancing arbitrage opportunities for users aiming for 0.3%-3% profit margins.
