# Product Introduction

## Bitrader

The Bitrader App aims to provide users with powerful tools to capture arbitrage opportunities in the cryptocurrency secondary market, covering core functions such as market monitoring, arbitrage trading, and market observation. Currently, the application specifically targets arbitrage in USDT-based perpetual contracts. Users only need to bind the exchange API to utilize Bitrader for real-time market monitoring and arbitrage trading. The innovative arbitrage order trading model adopted by Bitrader offers users a new and streamlined trading experience.

Bitrader's trading model is particularly suitable for use in extreme and highly volatile market conditions. Its core functionality allows the program to automatically close positions based on the user's set limit price once the market price reaches that level after opening a position. For users seeking low-risk arbitrage and high-frequency trading, Bitrader provides practical and user-friendly interactions to help achieve more robust arbitrage trading.

## How Does Bitrader Conduct Trades？

Bitrader conducts cryptocurrency trades by integrating with the exchange through an API connection. <mark style="color:blue;">**Users’ cryptocurrency assets are securely stored in their exchange accounts, and users retain full control over managing these assets.**</mark> Bitrader does not manage or hold any cryptocurrency assets.

Bitrader provides users with innovative trading models and enhanced earning opportunities through advanced trading concepts. When users initiate trades on Bitrader, the platform sends trading instructions to the exchange via the API. All order matching and execution are handled on the exchange itself.

## Concept

The secondary market investment in cryptocurrencies can generally be categorized by "cycle and trading frequency style" into: "Bitcoin long-term investments (typically 1 to 3 years), daily swing trading (with cycles usually ranging from a few weeks to several months), or high-frequency trading on minute to hourly charts." Bitrader is specifically designed for high-frequency trading on shorter timeframes, focusing on low-risk, stable trades. It is particularly useful for high-frequency, high-leverage traders, allowing them to set profit targets and automatically close positions, enhancing arbitrage opportunities for users aiming for 0.3%-3% profit margins.
