# Product Introduction

## Bitrader

The Bitrader app connects to the OKX exchange via API and is specifically designed for USDT-based perpetual contract arbitrage trading, offering users a "simple and hassle-free" trading experience.

Bitrader's trading model is particularly suitable for use in extreme and highly volatile market conditions. Its core functionality allows the program to automatically close positions based on the user's set limit price once the market price reaches that level after opening a position. For users seeking low-risk arbitrage and high-frequency trading, Bitrader provides practical and user-friendly interactions to help achieve more robust arbitrage trading.

## How Does Bitrader Conduct Trades？

Bitrader conducts cryptocurrency trades by integrating with the OKX exchange through an API connection. <mark style="color:blue;">**Users’ cryptocurrency assets are securely stored in their OKX exchange accounts, and users retain full control over managing these assets.**</mark> Bitrader does not manage or hold any cryptocurrency assets.

Bitrader provides users with innovative trading models and enhanced earning opportunities through advanced trading concepts. When users initiate trades on Bitrader, the platform sends trading instructions to the OKX exchange via the API. All order matching and execution are handled on the OKX exchange itself.

## How to get hands on your first trade?

After users complete the API configuration in the Bitrader App (API obtained from OKX), they can start using Bitrader to trade cryptocurrencies (currently, only OKX USDT-based perpetual contract pairs are supported).\

## Concept

The secondary market investment in cryptocurrencies can generally be categorized by "cycle and trading frequency style" into: "Bitcoin long-term investments (typically 1 to 3 years), daily swing trading (with cycles usually ranging from a few weeks to several months), or high-frequency trading on minute to hourly charts." Bitrader is specifically designed for high-frequency trading on shorter timeframes, focusing on low-risk, stable trades. It is particularly useful for high-frequency, high-leverage traders, allowing them to set profit targets and automatically close positions, enhancing arbitrage opportunities for users aiming for 0.3%-3% profit margins.
